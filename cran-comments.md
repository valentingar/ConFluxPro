## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed the redundant "A Toolkit"/"A suite to" from the title/description.

* Removed tailing spaces before line breaks in the description field.

* Added method references to the description field.

* Added missing \value to .Rd files to coercion.Rd, run_map.Rd, sobol_run_map.Rd.

* Changed all uses of if(FALSE) to \donttest{} for lengthy examples.

* Adapted check_soilphys() to use a single message() instead of cat().

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
