\arguments{
\item{gasdata}{A cfp_gasdata object created by running \code{cfp_gasdata()}.}

\item{soilphys}{A cfp_soilphys object created by running \code{cfp_soilphys()}.}

\item{layers_map}{A cfp_layers_map object created by running \code{cfp_layers_map}.}

\item{x}{An object of class cfp_dat}
}
\value{
A cfp_dat object with the following parameters:
\describe{
\item{gasdata}{The gasdata object with added column "gd_id" that is unique for each profile.}
\item{soilphys}{The soilphys object with added columns "sp_id" that is unique for each profile,
"step_id" indicating the position of each step from the bottom up, "height" in m of each layer,
"pmap" indicating which layer it belongs to from the bottom up. Potentially, some original
steps were split to account for the depths within gasdata or layers_map.}
\item{layers_map}{The layers_map object with added column "group_id" indicating each
unique group of the same layer parameterization set by layers_map.}
\item{profiles}{A \code{data.frame} where each row indicates one unique profile that
is characterised by all \code{id_cols} present in the original input as well as the correspongin
"gd_id", "sp_id", and "group_id". Each row has a unique identifier "prof_id".}
\item{id_cols}{A character vector of all columns that identify a profile uniquely.}
}
}
\description{
This is the essential object class that binds all necessary
input data to run a ConFluxPro model. It automatically combines the different
datasets and checks them for validity. It may split soilphys layers to correspond
with layers_map and gasdata depths.
