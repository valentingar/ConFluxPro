\usage{
production(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A valid \code{cfp_pfres()} or \code{cfp_fgres()} object.}

\item{...}{Further parameters passed on to \code{efflux()} in case of \code{cfp_fgres}.}
}
\value{
data.frame with prod_abs (\eqn{µmol / m^2 / s}), efflux (\eqn{µmol / m^2 / s}) and
\eqn{prod_rel = efflux / prod_abs}.
}
\description{
Easily extract the production of \code{cfp_pfres()} and
\code{cfp_fgres()} models per layer defined in \code{layers_map()} and calculate
the relative contribution per layer.
}
\details{
For a \code{pro_flux()} model, the extraction is straightforward
and simply the product of the optimised production rate (per volume) multiplied
by the height of the layer.

For \code{fg_flux()}, the assumption is made that the production of the layer
\eqn{i} is the difference of the flux in the layer above \eqn{F_{i+1}} and the layer below
\eqn{F_{i-1}}. The flux below the lowest layer is assumed to be zero and the flux above the
topmost layer is the efflux. This approach has some uncertainties and it should be
evaluated if it applies to your model.
