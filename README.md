<!-- badges: end -->

ConFluxPro helps calculating and modelling gas fluxes from soil gas data
using the flux-gradient approach (FGA) or using inverse modelling. It
provides different functions that help prepare the different datasets
required and modelling fluxes.

The package is still under development and syntax could change
significantly in the future. Keep this in mind when using it for your
own projects.

## Installation

Currently it is only possible to install the development version from
GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("valentingar/ConFluxPro")
```

However it is planned to get the package ready for CRAN in the future.
