# ConFluxPro
A toolkit for soil gas analysis

### Purpose
This is a package under development to facilitate flux calculation of soil gas concentration profiles using the gradient approach.

So far, it is still in an early development phase, not yet sufficiently tested and still has many-a-bugs.
Although I would not recommend building your research project on it at this point, feel free to download and test it yourselves.
I am very much looking forward to seeing your feedback.
